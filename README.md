## Advent of Code 2017

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) puzzles. My goal this year is to learn Go while solving the puzzles. Feedback welcome.

## Example

I've been running these like:

    cd day01
    go run main.go sum_ints_where_offset_char_matches.go

## Tests

Each solution has tests. Run them like:

    cd day01
    go test
